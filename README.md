# CleverShoppingList
A shopping list application, intended to reduce human work and error.

This is a college project I worked on and still personally use.
It's a fairly simple shopping list app, but it can be used to help budget out your shopping trips and meals.
You can create items with a name and a price which are stored indefinitely until the user decides to delete them. 
The items can be added to your shopping list as standalone items, or you can create recipes.
Recipes are a collection of items (intended for meal prep, but can be used for any combination of items for a project).
The recipes can be added to your shopping list to save time finding each item, and also allows you to understand how much a recipe costs.

The software is intended to be used by one person entirely on local storage, so there is no cloud saving, and no data harvesting.
