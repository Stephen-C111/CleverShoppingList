				   Text="In theory, this page could be the only page you ever use. It allows you to add new items, add previously created items, and check them off. That's not very different from just using pen and paper, but it is a little more convenient for it to be on your phone. "/>
					<Label HorizontalOptions="Center" HorizontalTextAlignment="Center" 
				   Text="Use the Add button to add your items to the list. Check off each item as you collect them in your cart, then use the Check-Out button when you have bought the items. If you need to edit the item's priority or price, you can tap anywhere on it except the checkbox to pull up an editing context menu."/>

You can make new items quickly on the items page, if you aren't ready to add them to your shopping list. If you click on an item, you can edit or delete it. Deleted items will be deleted from every part of the app, so be sure that you want to delete the item in question."/>

You can create recipes that hold a list of ingredients that are needed to fulfill a recipe. This obviously isn't limited to food, and you can even create custom recipes for DIY projects. The only limit really is your imagination."/>
					<Label HorizontalOptions="Center" HorizontalTextAlignment="Center" 
				   Text="Use the Add button to create a new recipe, insert a new name and the desired ingredients. Once you've saved a recipe, you can click on it like on any other screen to open a context menu. From this menu, you can edit, delete, or add the recipe to your shopping list."/>

					<Label HorizontalOptions="Center" HorizontalTextAlignment="Center" 
				   Text="The first report will list all of your items sorted by the total amount of money you've spent on each one. This is meant to provide insight into items that you may be spending too much on."/>
